            <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls,
                a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.</dd>
            
            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, 
                mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water. 
                Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
            
            <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
                It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
